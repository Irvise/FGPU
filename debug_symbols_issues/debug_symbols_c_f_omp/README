This test code contains a main driver which executes either a C OpenMP kernel, or three different kernels ( C OpenMP, FORTRAN OpenMP, CUDA FORTRAN ).

The FORTRAN OpenMP kernels and the CUDA FORTRAN kernel do not produce DWARF that the NVIDIA tools are recognizing.
The C OpenMP kernel debug info works by itself, but stops working if the FORTRAN kernels are compiled.

When using NVVP unguided analysis, pc sampling,  on the Fortran OMP kernel, it occassionally emits an error that the source file can't be found.
